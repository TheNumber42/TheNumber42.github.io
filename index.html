        <p style='font-size:25px; margin-left: 20px;'>Here's a time line of Vincent van Gogh's Life:</p>
        <div class="dates">
            <ul>
                <li><b>1853</b> - Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the
                    predominantly
                    Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands.</li>
                <li><b>1881</b> - Van Gogh's parents moved to the Etten countryside in April 1881</li>
                <li><b>1883</b>- Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Netherlands)</li>
                <li><b>1883</b> - Van Gogh relocated to Paris in March 1886, beginning a series of moves that the art
                    historian Melissa McQuillan believes also reflects later changes "in style, his reorientation of his
                    enterprise [which] might be linked".</li>
                <li><b>1886</b> - Ill from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles.
                </li>
                <li><b>1888</b> - When Gauguin agreed to visit Arles, Van Gogh hoped for friendship, and the realisation
                    of
                    his utopian idea of an artists' collective.</li>
                <li><b>1890</b> - Van Gogh entered the hospital at Saint Paul-de-Mausole on 8 May 1889 accompanied by
                    his
                    carer, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman.</li>
                <li><b>1890</b> - On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver (the gun
                    was
                    never found).</li>
            </ul>
